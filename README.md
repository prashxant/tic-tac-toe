# Tic Tac Toe in Python

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. One player is 'X' and the other player is 'O'. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol.
3. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game is a draw.
